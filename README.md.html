	</header>

	<section>
		<h2>Outline</h2>
		<p>
			Individually research up to 3 collaborative research areas
			using a recognized industry publication. Investigate a topic
			in theoretical computer science. Make webpages to report the
			information. Use Git / GitHub to manage project. CSS is not
			necessary, but HTML formatting (titles, headings, paragraphs)
			are needed.
		</p>
	</section>

		<h2>Collaborative Research Areas</h2>

		<p>
			You must use the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/" target="_blank">Association of Computing Machinists (ACM) Digital Library</a>
			(search for free articles but may need to register with a free account
			using FAKE personally identifiable information) or the
			<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp" target="_blank">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore digital library</a>
			(filtering for Open Access Only articles) for your collaborative research
			areas.
			<br><br>
			<del>
				Hint: Use AI to help you summarize the articles so you can see if it has the
				information you need.
			</del>
		</p>

		<h3>Details</h3>

		<p>For each collaborative research area, explain</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How the collaborative research area uses computer science</li>
			<li>A positive impact of the collaborative research area on a society/culture around the world</li>
			<li>A negative impact of the collaborative research area on a society/culture around the world,</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Examples of collaborative research areas include (but are not limited to):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bioinformatics</li>
			<li>Geology/Geomatics/Geoinformatic</li>
