# Exploring Computer Science (HTML Review)

## Outline

Individually research up to 3 collaborative research areas
using a recognized industry publication. Investigate a topic
in theoretical computer science. Make webpages to report the
information. Use Git / GitHub to manage project. CSS is not necessary, but HTML formatting (titles, headings, paragraphs) are needed.

## Collaborative Research Areas

You must use the Association of Computing Machinists (ACM) Digital Library at [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/) (search for free articles but may need to register with a free account using FAKE personally identifiable information) or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore digital library at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) (filtering for Open Access Only articles) for your collaborative research areas. Hint: Use AI to help you summarize the articles so you can see if it has the information you need.

### Details

For each collaborative research area, explain

- How the collaborative research area uses computer science
- A positive impact of the collaborative research area on a society/culture around the world
- A negative impact of the collaborative research area on a society/culture around the world,

Examples of collaborative research areas include (but are not limited to):

- Bioinformatics
- Geology/Geomatics/Geoinformatic
- Economics
- Linguistics
- Health Informatics
- Climatology
- Sociology
- Banking
- Retail
- Robot
- Agriculture/Farming
- Art
- Music
- Fashion
- Accounting
- Cars
- Drones
- Planes
- Sports
- Finance

## Theoretical Computer Science

Theoretical computer science studies mathematical and abstract areas of computer science. Here is list of topics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science
